                    <p class="pa">
                        When building a game engine it can be difficult 
                        to keep track of what your code execution looks like 
                        and where time is being spent in your game, especially if it's running on <span class="colored">multiple threads.</span>
                        That's why I wanted to make a tool to measure performance in our engine.

            <h3> Collecting data </h3>

            <p class="pa">
                There are several ways you could collect your data,
                but all of them include starting and stopping a timer. 
                I wanted to make adding this timer as easy as possible to 
                enable the use of the tool throughout our codebase.
                Another requirement i had was to allow the collection of data 
                to be turned off when building and releasing the game. 
            </p>

            <p class="pa">
                The idea to time the code was simple, create a stack-allocted object 
                in the top of the current scope, push the current time on construction of the object
                to a stack, and in the destructor we pop the top of stack and record the time it took from
                construction to now.
            </p>

            <p class="pa">
                This works well for several reasons, 
                one benefit of using an object with a destructor is that the destructor is 
                guaranteed to be called when going out of scope.
                Another benefit is that as long as the object is the first to be created, it will always
                be the last one to be destroyed as objects in C++ are destructed in reverse construction order.
                This means that any possible destructors of objects we want to include in our 
                timings will get captured as well.
            </p>

            <h3> The macro </h3>
            <p class="pa">
                I decided to utilize a macro to generate
                information like a unique name, the current function name and line numbers for the object.
                macros are great for this purpose as they can easily be turned off to completely
                remove any trace of our profiling.
                MSVC has the <span class="colored">__FUNCTION__</span> macro which I will use. 
                This macro is replaced with a formatted string of the current function name during preprocessing.
                It would be possible to use <span class="colored">__func__</span> aswell however it does not include
                namespace/class names.
            </p>
            
            <pre>
                <code class="language-cpp">  
                class ProfileScope
                {
                public:
                    ProfileScope(const char* aFunction, const char* aFile, unsigned int aLine);
                    ~ProfileScope();
                    ProfileScope(const ProfileScope&) = delete;
                    ProfileScope(ProfileScope&&) = delete;
                }

                #define MYS_PROFILE_SCOPE(NAME) UNIQUE_NAME(NAME, __FILE__, __LINE__)

            <p class="pa">
                One of the goals of the profiler was to allow you to collect data from any number of threads simultaneously.
                This has to be done in a cheap manner to influence the time code takes to execute as little as possible, 
                after all we don't want our results to change when measuring it.
            </p>
            <p class="pa">
                As the main thread needs all thread's list of timings after the frame to visualize them, 
                they somehow need to be stored in a shared container. I use a simple vector where the thread's ID is
                an index to it's local list of timings. This id needs to be small enough to be used as an index, so using 
                <span class="colored">std::this_thread::get_id</span> was not possible. My solution instead was to write my own
                simple <i>thread id</i> function.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-cpp">
                    ThreadID GetCurrentThreadID()
                    {
                        static std::atomic_uint32_t nextID = 0;
                        static thread_local ThreadID currentID{ nextID++ };
                        return currentID;
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p class="pa">
                The id's will now start at 0 and increase to the number of used threads. 
                The atomic variable will ensure that no threads can increment the <span class="colored">nextID</span> variable at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="pa">
                Currently our list of timings look a little like <span class="colored">std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;TimingResult&gt;&gt;</span>,
                if we encounter a thread who's ID is larger than the current size of the array, 
                the array would neet to be resized. this operation also need to be thread-safe. 
                below is the helper I use to get the current thread's timing results. it implements a simple <span class="colored">spinlock</span>.
            </p>

            <pre>
                <code class="language-cpp">
                    std::vector&lt;TimingResult&gt;&amp; ProfileData::GetResultsFromThreadID(ThreadID anID)
                    {
                        static std::atomic_bool getting = false;
                
                        while (getting.exchange(true));
                
                        if (anID.id >= myThreadResults.size())
                            myThreadResults.resize(anID.id + 1);

                        getting.store(false);
                
                        return myThreadResults[anID.id];
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="pa">
                However there is still a problem. If another thread resizes while we are using our returned vector, 
                the vector would be moved in memory and the reference would become invalid. My solution to this is to 
                allocate memory on the heap for the vector using a <span class="colored">unique_ptr</span>.
                This has the added benefit that if we have returned once, we can store the vector as a <span class="colored">thread_local</span> 
                which means we never have to lock on that thread again. Making this system almost <span class="colored">lock-free.</span>
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion </h2>
            <p class="pa">
                We now have all the parts nesscesary to use this data and visualize it as we please. 
                I used <a class="link" href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui's</a> drawlist 
                to render all collected data in our engine's editor. The tool has so far been useful on multiple occations by other group members
                to find and resolve performance bottlenecks in our codebase.
            </p>

            <p class="pa">
                Overall I'm very pleased with how the profiler turned out. 
                There is however some areas i would like to improve given more time,
                for example the ability to sum the duration of all functions for a given type or saving/loading the history of frames to disk.
