                During game project 7 we had a need to view and edit components from our editor, 
                and since we ideally wanted to keep our editor/game projects separated which meant no component-specific code, 
                I was tasked with making a reflection system.
            </p>
            
            <h2> What is reflection? </h2>
            <p class="pa">
                In programming, reflection refers to the ability of a 
                program to examine and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime.
                Some languages like <span class="colored">C#</span> and <span class="colored">Java</span> 
                support reflection nativly. this enables them to support features
                like automatic serialization/deserialization or creating objects from names.
                <br>

                However, one of the core ideas of C++ is that 
                <span class="colored"> you only pay for what you use.</span>
                For reflection this means that any metadata of the program's original structure 
                is lost during compilation and it's up to the programmer to implement
                any features needed to support reflection.

            <p class="pa">
                Some of my goals with the reflection system besides providing a 
                way to edit components outside of the <i>editor</i> was:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> No extra data stored on components, copying and moving components had to remain fast. </li>
                <li> No need to inherit from any classes to support reflection for that type </li>
                <li> Support for common stl-containers like <span class="colored">vector</span> and <span class="colored">unordered_map</span> </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Registration</h2>
            <p class="pa">
                With the first requirement in mind, I decided on creating a registry to store the data, 
                a class with static methods where you register a type's members once at the start of the program, 
                and can then later be globally used to query type information 
                by using for example the registered name or an instance of the object.
            </p>
            <p class="pa">
                The registration of a type is done in the following manner:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-cpp">
                    MetaRegistry::RegisterClass&lt;Foo&gt;("Foo")
                        .RegisterMember("bar", &Foo::bar)
                        .RegisterMember("baz", &Foo::baz);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="pa">
                As all registered classes are templated, they inherit from the common class
                <span class="colored">IMetaClass</span>. This class is an interface that
                allow us to query a given type without knowing the type that is reflected.
                <br>
                Registering members of a class is similar, however 
                they are stored on each class and is done by utilizing 
                the <span class="colored"><i>pointers to members</i></span> syntax. The implementation of 
                <span class="colored">RegisterMember</span> looks like the following:
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-cpp">
                        template &lt;typename MemberType&gt;
                        MetaClass& RegisterMember(const char* aName, MemberType ClassType::* aMember)
                        {
                            myMembers.emplace_back(
                                std::make_unique&lt;MetaMember&lt;ClassType, MemberType&gt;&gt;(aName, aMember)
                            );
                            return *this;
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre> 
                <p class="pa">
                    Where the <span class="colored">ClassType</span> 
                    template is the owner of the current member.
                </p>
            </p>

            <h2>How I needed the reflection system</h2>
            <p class="pa">
                As this system was intended mostly as a way to edit components 
                from an <span class="colored">inspector</span>, I needed a way to to check if
                an entity in our <a class="link" href="../projects/ecs.html">entity component system</a> 
                contained any reflectable types, the way i chose to meet this requirement
                was by iterating all reflected types, then calling a virtual function 
                that returns true if the selected entity owns a component of the current type.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-cpp">
                    for (IMetaClass& type : MetaRegistry::Classes())
                    {
                        if (type.Contains(aRegistry, aSelectedEntity))
                        {
                            std::unique_ptr&lt;IMetaReference&gt; reference = type.CreateReference(aRegistry, aSelectedEntity);
                            RenderWidget(reference, aRegistry, aSelectedEntity);
                        }
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>

            <h2>Creating references to members</h2>
            <p class="pa">
                In the above example, i use the method CreateReference, this
                method is simply a virtual function that gets the object out of our 
                entity component system and stores it as a pointer in the 
                <span class="colored">MetaReference</span>-class.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>

            <p class="pa">    
                The MetaMember class however currently just stores
                a <i>Pointer to a member</i> which looks like 
                <span class="colored">MemberType ClassType::*</span>. 
                This is not a normal pointer, we need an instance of <span class="colored">ClassType</span>
                to dereference it. Luckily since we already store a reference to the
                <i>ClassType</i>-object, and <i>ClassType</i> is a known type in
                the <span class="colored">MetaMember</span>-class we can 
                cast the type-erased reference back into it's real type.
                <br>
                <br>
                This allows us to create references to members of classes as well.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-cpp">
                    std::unique_ptr&lt;IMetaReference&gt; CreateReference(IMetaReference& aParentClass)
                    {
                        ClassType& parent = *static_cast&lt;MetaReference&lt;ClassType&gt;&amp;&gt;(aParent).GetReference();
                        return std::make_unique&lt;MetaReference&lt;MemberType&gt;&gt;(parent.*memberPointer, GetName());
                    }
                    MemberType ClassType::* memberPointer;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p class="pa">
                Casting type-erased interface classes back into 
                their templated derived class through virtual functions like this is 
                something i have utilized heavily in this
                system. And while not very pretty, it's needed as I need to 
                store and operate on them without knowing their types at compile-time.
            </p>

            <h2>Iterating and rendering the members</h2>
            <h3>The first approach</h3>
            <p class="pa">
                My first approach to rendering through a given type's members was done 
                by looping through all members of the current type each recursive call, and when
                encountering a type that's known, for example fundamental types like 
                <span class="colored">int</span> and <span class="colored">float</span>,
                I called the appropriate function to handle that type.
                <br>
                <br>
                That method looked similar to the following example:
            </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-cpp">
                        void RenderWidget(IMetaReference& aReference)
                        {
                            ImGui::Text(aReference.GetName());
                            if (HasKnownEditingFunction(aReference))
                            {
                                EditType(aReference);
                                return;
                            }

                            ImGui::Indent();
                            for (IMetaMember& memberType : aReference.GetMembers())
                            {
                                std::unique_ptr&lt;IMetaReference&gt; memberReference = member.CreateReference(aReference);
                                RenderWidget(memberReference);
                            }
                            ImGui::Unindent();
                        }
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p class="pa">
                However this method was flawed in that it both required 
                quite a few heap-allocations more than might be nesscesary,
                but more importantly, it was flawed in the way that
                it wasn't possible to loop through the members of
                templated stl-types like vector or a more difficult example, tuples.
                Not without registering each possible instantiation of that type.
            </p>
            <h3>The second approach</h3>
            <p class="pa">
                After scratching my head for a while and trying different
                solutions to the problems with the first method, I finally tried
                to utilize the <span class="colored"><i>Visitor pattern</i></span>.

                <br>
                The visitor pattern approach allowed me to specialize 
                the way members of a type should be iterated by creating a
                template specialization of the MetaReference class. While this is not
                a perfect solution, it allows me to iterate through types that would
                otherwise be impossible without an explicit registration 
                of that type and it's exact template parameters.
                <br>
                <br>
                The editor now inherits from a <i>Visitor</i> class
                and the iteration is updated like the following example:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-cpp">
                    class EditorVisitor : public MetaVisitor

                        {
                            ImGui::Text(aReference.GetName());
                            if (HasKnownEditingFunction(aReference))
                            {
                                EditType(aReference);
                            }
                            else

                                {
                                    std::unique_ptr&lt;IMetaReference&gt; memberReference = memberType.CreateReference(aReference);
                                    memberReference->Visit(*this);

                Utilizing templates like this allowed the reflection system
                to become very flexible, and support almost any type with minimal effort. But it's not 
                without it's shortcomings.
            </p>

            Some things i would like to improve include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Refactorization: the systems has gone through 
                    multiple iterations and could use some cleanup
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support for member functions, this is teoretically not that much more work
                    and would be a nice addition.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding support for base classes, currently each registration needs to include
                    it's base classes members as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inspector formatting: The formatting for complex types in the inspector 
                    is not ideal, this is something i would like to improve.
                </li>
            </ul>
